# Lagalt - Backend
## Overview
This repository contains the code for the backend of the LagAlt project handed out as a mandatory exercise at the Noroff acceleration program (spring 2023).

The project consists of creating the website lagalt.no, a platform that aims to facilitate connecting individuals in creative fields with projects that requires specific skills. Users can browse projects in anonymous mode, but need to register in order to apply to join or create projects. After registering, the user accesses their profile page which contains a portfolio of their projects.

The website uses Oauth for handling authentication, and the website's backend exposes REST API endpoints and utilizes SQLServer for the database.
